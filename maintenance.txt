CI/CD Setup Documentation:
CI Pipeline:

The CI pipeline is defined in the .github/workflows directory.
The pipeline is triggered for any push or pull request event on the master branch.
Continuous Deployment:

Ensure that your application is always deployed to production upon successful testing and quality checks.
This setup uses GitHub Actions to automate the entire process of testing, linting, security scanning, and deployment.
Troubleshooting:

Linting Errors: Ensure code follows PEP8 guidelines and try running flake8 locally before pushing.
Formatting Issues: Run black . to auto-format the code.
Security Alerts: If Bandit raises any alerts, check the code for vulnerabilities like insecure imports or hardcoded credentials.
Test Failures: Make sure that all unit tests pass locally before pushing.
